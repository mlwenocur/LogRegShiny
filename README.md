# LogRegShiny
Code for logistic regression Shiny app hosted on mwenocur/shinyapps.io
The file logRegTrainer.R is where all the heavy backend R processing takes place. It incorporates a great deal more support for enhancing the trainer's versatility. For example, it supports the creation of user defined models with factors having interactions. Someday I would like to extend the current model once I better understand Shiny's input capabilities.

LogRegTrainer.R certainly is in need of judicious editing to improve its intelligibility. (Life is short (: )
